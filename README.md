# BobzBurger
Bob's Burgers FanPage made C# using the ASP.NET CORE and Bootstrap. 

This BobsBurgers is not a licensed product of the cartoon but a fan site made while learning Razor and ASP.NET CORE.
This site was made from a modified version of [Jess Chadwick's ASP.NET CORE RAZOR Tutorial] (https://github.com/jchadwick/LearnAspNetCoreRazorPages)
